# Sliding Mode Control
This current project deals with the robust control of a given system with uncertainties, using **sliding mode control**, for both **regulation**
and **tracking**. The system is simulated using _MATLAB_ in order to analyze its behavior under the effect of the designed controller
and the results are presented.
